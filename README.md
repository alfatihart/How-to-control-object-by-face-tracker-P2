Hey guys, sorry for making you wait. I don't have too much time to make videos because of my work.
I didn't spend a lot of time creating game filters, but I spent a lot of time making tutorial videos. Because I understand the difficulties of beginners or those who have not had much experience with Spark AR. Therefore, I spent a lot of time thinking about how I can help you easily understand how filters work, I also removed the complicated things and instead patch packs help you easily. than to make game filters for yourself.
Thank you for always watching and accompanying me this year. 2019 is special. And I wish you a happy and happy new year 2020!

In this part 2, I will show you how to use the patch editor to control characters, make objects move, and use some of the patches that I have built to make it easier for you to create a game filter.
There are 3 patches that I have built and you only need to use them for your project: the patch for object moves with random position. faster duration patch and collision check patch.
